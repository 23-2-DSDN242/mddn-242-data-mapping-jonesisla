## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.


Teleporting Cat by Isla Jones

In the project I initially wanted to use the idea of having my cat appear like it was from an alternate dimension, and I ended up with the outcome of having a cat looking like it was teleporting/warping which I was quite happy with. I like that in my outcomes I can clearly see my cat and the background is warped. I tested out having the background blurred/having the cat warped and the background normal but I think it looks a lot better when you can clearly see the cat and the background is being warped. 

I did quite a few different tests and ended up with a training set of 15 images for the AI to use and I got a decent amount of AI generated masks back. I ended up training the AI to recognise my black and white cat charlie. And I found that when I had a different cat that was a different colour, the AI struggled to identify and mask the other cat properly which I was happy with.
